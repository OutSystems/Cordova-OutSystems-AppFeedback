# Cordova Plugin for OutSystems App Feedback

## OutSystems App Feedback

OutSystems App Feedback will allow customers to collect users' feedback from their mobile applications. To submit feedback, users can use their tablets or smartphones to simply draw on the screen, add a voice notes, or just type something in. Everything the user sees and annotates gets balled up into a nice user story that developers can review in a beautiful interface that also allows them to jump directly to the screen in question and begin implementing the change.
